## Technology Checklist

Your projects should emphasize the technologies you've
learned. Remember, the projects are a showcase of your technical
ability. Make sure to demonstrate what you can do!

### Rails

* ~~Basic CRUD~~
* ~~Complex forms~~
* ~~Authentication~~
    * I'd make my own rather than use Devise.
* Bootstrap (SF only)
* ActionMailer/Sendgrid
* Partials, helpers
* ~~Routing~~
* File upload (paperclip or filepicker.io)
* Pagination
* Consuming 3rd Party APIs
* Omniauth
* delayed_job

### JavaScript/Backbone

* ~~jQuery~~
    * jQuery UI: draggable/sortable
